# Riemann Zeta Zero Explorer

This project visualizes and explores the zero structure of the Riemann zeta function using symbolic and numerical tools.

## Features

- Zoom into known Riemann zeros with precise scaling.
- Visualize `arg(ζ(s))`, `Re(ζ(s))`, and custom derived functions `Z_b(t)`.
- Predict locations of zeros using analytic and phase structure.
- Built using Python, SymPy, NumPy, Plotly, and Dash.

## Run It

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
zeroapp.py
